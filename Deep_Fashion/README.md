#Project name: Deep Fashion 
#Project term: Summer of 2018 
#Project participants (interns): Wayne, Kelson, Young-Joo 
#Object of the project: building a model that detects and classifies clothes 
#How this folder is organized: 
######actual data: where to find the dataset we cleaned
######comments: our thoughts on the performance of our model as well as how to improve it 
######data cleaning: codes we used to clean data in case they need to be cleaned again 
######data visualization: codes used for visualizing our data to understand the contents better
######materials: useful documentations as well as our powerpoint presentation files 
######tfrecord: contains codes for generating tfrecord 

####The fastest way to understand how the project is structured and has been done would be to go through our powerpoint files inside the materials/ppt/ folder. With everthing in this folder (especially the inference graph and the label map), it should be possible to build a model. If you would like to use the model on an image, on videos, or on a webcam, you can use this link, which will direct you to a useful Github repository that lays out how to do that in detail: https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-API-Tutorial-Train-Multiple-Objects-Windows-10

####Since the model is still a working progress, we have documented all of our process so that changes can be made easily (such as changing the number of categories).

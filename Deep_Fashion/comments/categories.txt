The final 17 categories we decided on are: 
- thick cotton sweater / thin cotton sweater / wool sweater / short sleeve top / sleeveless top
- jeans / trousers / leggings / comfortable pants / shorts / short skirt / long skirt
- long full-body wear / short full-body wear 
- cardigan / blazer / winter wear 

The characteristics of clothes we took into consideration when coming up with these categories are: 
- what part of the body does it cover? (top / bottom / full-body) 
- do you wear it on its own or on top of other clothes? (inner wear / outer wear) 
- length of sleeves (short sleeve / long sleeve / sleeveless) 
- material (thin cotton / thick cotton / wool) 
- well-known types (jeans / leggings / blazer

Problems: 
- does not include certain clothes such as underwear, swimsuits, traditional clothes, etc., etc. 
- there is still ambiguity for certain clothes 
- does not distinguish between dresses and jumpsuits 

Solutions: 
- make the categories more specific, which would be enabled by having a bigger dataset 
- the solution would differ based no the purpose of the model (whether it's going to be used at clothes shops, etc)
